# Azure-Onboarding-Dashboard
Azure Onboarding Dashboard (AOD) helps to monitor and manage tasks related to onboarding an Azure Subscription (compliance, budgeting, access management, etc.)

## General Idea [#1](https://github.com/ffive-xyz/Azure-Onboarding-Dashboard/issues/1)
This project is made (in spare time) with the intention of the following points:

- Create an application that is easy to distribute - users should be able to install the application on their own environment (preferably on Azure)
- Infer Access to AOD (from resource group access on azure)
- All configuration to be stored as config file for easy import/export
- Ability to manage policy for azure subscription
- Access control to subscription/resource group
- Budget for subscription/resource group

Suggestions are welcome and may be considered at a later stage when project reaches v1
